#### Teiid offers a relational abstraction of all information sources that is highly performant and allows for integration with your existing relational tools. Teiid has an accompanying easy-to-use [design tool](../tools/index.html) that enables data architects to integrate disparate information in minutes.

Teiid has a [long history](../about/history) of addressing the data access needs of any size enterprise environment.  Have a look at [Why Teiid?](../about/why), our [feature matrix](../about/featurematrix/index.html), and [FAQ](../about/faq/index.html) to see if this project is a good fit for your needs.

Teiid is [open source](../about/license) and has been a part of the [JBoss Community](http://jboss.org) of projects for nearly 10 years.
