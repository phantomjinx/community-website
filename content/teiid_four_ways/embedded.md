[**Teiid 4 Ways**](..) &nbsp;&nbsp; < &nbsp;&nbsp; [Wildfly] (../teiid_wildfly) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; [Wildfly Swarm](../wildfly_swarm) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; [Microservices](../microservices) &nbsp;&nbsp; | &nbsp;&nbsp; **Embedded**

**Teiid Embedded** is a light-weight version of Teiid for use in any Java 7+ JRE. WildFly nor any application server is not required. This feature is still evolving. Please consult the source examples and even unit tests utilizing the EmbeddedServer for a more complete guide as to its use.

See [**The Embedded Examples**](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-embedded-examples) for how to integrate multiple, heterogeneous data stores and enterprise services in a light-weight way.

Check out [**Teiid Spring Boot**](https://github.com/teiid/teiid-spring-boot) enable Teiid in Spring Boot applications.

We're also working on integrating Teiid Embedded into [**Wildfly Swarm**](https://github.com/wildfly-swarm).  See our curent [**Examples**](https://github.com/teiid/wildfly-swarm-teiid-examples) of how you can get started.
