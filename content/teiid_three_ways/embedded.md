**Teiid Embedded** is a light-weight version of Teiid for use in any Java 7+ JRE application.

If you are needing a simpler approach to accessing data from stable/static sources, *Teiid Embedded* may be a simpler approach for accessing your data from within your application code.

For *Teiid Embedded*, your connections are configured <TBD> and your VDB metadata can be deployed via Teiid API calls. You still have the option of managing your VDBs via tooling or programmatically generate them.
